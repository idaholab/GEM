# GEM

The General Entity Model (GEM) is a foundational ontology that may be used for the creation of domain-specific ontologies. GEM is formed using parts of various other foundational ontologies including:  
- [BFO](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO)  
- [LML](https://lifecyclemodeling.org/about-lml/)  
- [IAO](https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO/)
- [OWL Time](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/)  

Elements of these foundational ontologies are combined in a way that is human-friendly while being both comprehensive in terms of scope and concise in terms of classes and other ontology elements. The intention of GEM is that a user may apply it as a foundation for building a more specific ontology. This can be done by copying GEM and adding child classes and properties to those already existing withing GEM.
